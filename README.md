# AmundsenSeaPolynyaPaper

Find here the scripts for processing data and making figures in the paper:

Macdonald GJ, Ackley SF, Mestas-Nu√±ez AM (submitted) Evolution of the Amundsen Sea Polynya, Antarctica. The Cryosphere.

Many of the scripts could be made more efficient, and they may include redundant lines that have not been deleted after testing various things.
Get in touch with grant.macdonald@utsa.edu if you have any questions.

All processing was done with free software. All processing scripts for Python, except where indicated. The exceptions are one step of data processing was done
with GDAL directly in the Terminal on a Mac and Video S1 was created in Google Earth Engine. Other processing was done manually in QGIS, as indicated.

BedMachine Antarctica V2 was downloaded from: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0756. 
Sea ice concentration data was downloaded from: https://seaice.uni-bremen.de. 
ERA5 climate data was downloaded from: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu. 
Sentinel-1 images were processed in Google Earth Engine or downloaded from: https://asf.alaska.edu
The MODIS image used for Fig. 1b was downloaded from: https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/

Information on each figure - and the data used in it, below.

##Figures
This directory includes scripts for figures where applicable, or otherwise states where the figure was created.
'* indicates script provided. All scripts are provided in this repository, except the Google Earth Engine script for Video S1, which is at the provided link.
If there is no script, it is because it was created 'manually'.

#FIG1
Created in QGIS (QGIS.org). Fig. 1a utilizes the free QGIS package 'Quantarctica' (https://www.npolar.no/en/quantarctica/) and 1b uses a MODIS image from https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/

#FIG2
Created in QGIS. Figs. 1a-d use Sentinel-1 images downloaded from ASF (https://asf.alaska.edu/) and BedMachine v2 data from (https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0756)

#FIG3
Created in QGIS using Sentinel-1 image downloaded from ASF.
