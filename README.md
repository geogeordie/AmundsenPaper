# AmundsenSeaPolynyaPaper

Find here the scripts for processing data and making figures in the paper:

Macdonald GJ, Ackley SF, Mestas-Nu√±ez AM (submitted) Evolution of the Amundsen Sea Polynya, Antarctica. The Cryosphere.

Many of the scripts could be made more efficient, and they may include redundant lines that have not been deleted after testing various things.
Get in touch with grant.macdonald@utsa.edu if you have any questions.

All processing was done with free software. All processing scripts for Python, except where indicated. The exceptions are one step of data processing was done
with GDAL directly in the Terminal on a Mac and Video S1 was created in Google Earth Engine. Other processing was done manually in QGIS, as indicated.
